## Notes
Most of the documentation is identical to [Web3](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.5.2/web3.html)

Still, there are too many inconsistencies to the actual code. I relied more on the `d.ts` files than on
the documentation.

The functionalities are reduced greatly, as settings the provider should be a secure process only
allowed to do by the service provider, as malicious URL's etc. could lead to a stolen private key.
